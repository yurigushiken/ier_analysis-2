  research_question: "Do participants in each cohort fixate all relevant arguments during GIVE-with-toy events (70% on-screen trials)?"
  hypothesis: "Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all three arguments more often than older infants and adults."
  prediction: "10+ month infants and adults will show higher tri-argument fixation rates than 7-9 month infants."
