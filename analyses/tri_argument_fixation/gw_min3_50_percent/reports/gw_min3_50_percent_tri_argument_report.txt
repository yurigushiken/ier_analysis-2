Research Question: Do participants in each cohort fixate all relevant arguments during GIVE-with-toy events (50% on-screen trials)?
Hypothesis: Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all three arguments more often than older infants and adults.
Prediction: 10+ month infants and adults will show higher tri-argument fixation rates than 7–9 month infants.

Results:
- 7-month-olds: 8/23 trials (34.8% coverage, 7 participants)
- 8-month-olds: 12/25 trials (48.0% coverage, 7 participants)
- 9-month-olds: 14/32 trials (43.8% coverage, 9 participants)
- 10-month-olds: 26/39 trials (66.7% coverage, 11 participants)
- 11-month-olds: 14/21 trials (66.7% coverage, 7 participants)
- Adults: 33/40 trials (82.5% coverage, 13 participants)
