report:
  research_question: "Do participants fixate the giver, recipient, and toy location during frames 40–110 of GIVE-without-toy trials?"
  hypothesis: "Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all arguments within frames 40–110 more often than older infants and adults."
  prediction: "10+ month infants and adults will show higher tri-argument fixation rates than 7–9 month infants even within this mid-trial window."
