report:
  research_question: "Do participants fixate all GIVE-with-toy arguments during frames 40–110 of each trial?"
  hypothesis: "Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all three arguments within frames 40–110 more often than older infants and adults."
  prediction: "10+ month infants and adults will show higher tri-argument fixation rates than 7–9 month infants within this mid-trial window."
