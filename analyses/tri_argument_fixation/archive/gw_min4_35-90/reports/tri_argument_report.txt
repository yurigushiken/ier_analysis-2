Research Question: Do participants fixate all GIVE-with-toy arguments during frames 40–110 of each trial?
Hypothesis: Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all three arguments within frames 40–110 more often than older infants and adults.
Prediction: 10+ month infants and adults will show higher tri-argument fixation rates than 7–9 month infants within this mid-trial window.

Results:
- 7-month-olds: 6/40 trials (15.0% coverage, 8 participants)
- 8-month-olds: 6/47 trials (12.8% coverage, 9 participants)
- 9-month-olds: 10/41 trials (24.4% coverage, 11 participants)
- 10-month-olds: 16/45 trials (35.6% coverage, 11 participants)
- 11-month-olds: 9/32 trials (28.1% coverage, 9 participants)
- Adults: 20/40 trials (50.0% coverage, 13 participants)
